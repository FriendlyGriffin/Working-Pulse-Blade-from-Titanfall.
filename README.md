# Working-Pulse-Blade-from-Titanfall.
Using a mix of Lidar and Raspberry Pi, mostly Raspberry Pi Pico W2. 
Using one main board in an airsoft helmet using a battery pack and LCD screen. On the other hand, in the knife Lidar scanner, the Raspberry Pi Pico W2 is connected to the main one using Wi-Fi. LED lights for shits and giggles.
On the blade side, the knife has a button clap and a spring. Once held down on the spring/button, it activates a script for the lidar to work and scan, and make a silhouette of the area around it.
